# English Preparation School Notes

- This project has been created to document notes taken for english studying.

- They are my personal notes and may contain my comments.
  
- There are 2 different type of notes -> Hand-written and Notion.

- They are notes taken during the classes in Preparation School in Eskisehir and Lanuguage School in Brighton.
  
- One of my main source of information was Ekrem Uzbay - Proficiency book.
